# VolleyApplication
This basically consists of how to use the volley library and recycler view simultaneously in android.
For this i have used two libraries 
1. compile 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:23.0.1'
2. compile 'com.mcxiaoke.volley:library:1.0.17'
These are the two libraries which I have integrated in this application.
This application simply fetches the data from the server and using volley library it parses the JSON.
Then using recycler view it shows the list which has all the movies in it.
